Juice(one)Example in the project

I have added Screenshake in this project. I feel it to be interesting especially when the user is bored with the game and a shake pops out, giving a good
feel about the game. 

## Reflection (Iteration 2)

I totally messed up last time. I hope I fixed all the issues that was  in last iteration. I had to start it all again with this project.
It went interesting to develop a full working game with some polish.I learnt from many sources for this iteration from youtube and godot documents.
It was nice to see how a same method is done in many ways. I still need to figure out adding another juice to the game
